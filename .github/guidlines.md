Every new addition to a project need to go through couple of steps

- Product manager creates issue and puts it in backlog
- Issue is moving into current sprint iteration
- Create a pull request and link it with issue
- Each commit need to be reviewed by at least one other member of a Team
- Each commit need to be validated by action (clean install, test, build, deploy)
- Commit is merged and moved to done column
